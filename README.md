## Overview of the statistical analysis:

This statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The investors in the project wants to analysis the weather data of the island to determine if the islands weather would be ideal for the surf and ice cream shop.

## Results:

Analyzing the temperature data for the month of June and December in Oahu, we can observe:
-	Although the mean temperature in Junes is about 4 degrees higher than December. December still has an average temperature above 70 degrees, creating ideal temperature for surfers to spend long days out waiting for the perfect wave year-round.
-	Both June and December have maximum temperatures above 80 degrees, which implies there are perfect weather days year-round for patrons to enjoy ice cream by the beach.
-	The minimum temperature	in December at 56 is significantly lower than in June. But with a 25 percentile at 69 degrees, the data implies 75% of the days should have ideal temperature conditions with the weather over 70 degrees.

The complete statistical analysis for both month are below:

## Summary:

According to the results of the temperature statistical analysis for June and December, the data shows the temperature year-round would allow for the sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop in the island of Oahu, Hawaii. To further support this analysis, we can perform the following two additional queries:

-	Maximum, Minimum and Average Precipitation by month
-	Statistical Analysis of the temperature for June and December for just last year.


With these 2 additional queries we can have a clearer picture of how the weather could affect the surf and ice cream business venture.
